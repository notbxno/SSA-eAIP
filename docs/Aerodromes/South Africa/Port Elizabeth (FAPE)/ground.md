# Ground
!!! info
    Port Elizabeth does not have a dedicated Ground frequency, as such all Ground responsibilities are assumed by Port Elizabeth Tower (FAPE_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FAPE_GND position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with the controller assuming SMC responsibility, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.
At Port Elizabeth, filing a flight plan as VFR is not mandatory unlike Cape Town, so you do not need to ask for a pilot to file a flight plan.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSDUR, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 08, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."

## Taxiway Restrictions

!!! note "Notes"

    A3 is not to be used as an Intersection Departure. It is solely exit-only for small aircraft for either Runway 08 or 26.

## Pushback Procedures

**An aircraft must be squawking their assigned ASSR code provided in the clearance before pushback clearance is issued. If this is not the case, the SMC controller must instruct the pilot to do so BEFORE any push clearance is issued.**

!!! info "Pushback Phraseology"
    "(callsign), push and start approved, face (direction), QNH (QNH)."

## Taxi Procedures

!!! info "Taxi Phraseology"
    "(callsign), taxi to holding point A4, via A, cross the threshold Runway 17".

## Arriving Aircraft
Upon arrival into Port Elizabeth, inbound aircraft are to provide their aircraft registration (tail number) and their parking bay (stand number) that they desire. The aircraft can be instructed to taxi to the bay.

!!! info "Pilot Reporting Bay Number"
    SAA233: "SAA233, we are ZS-SZF looking for Bay A1."

!!! info "Taxiing to the Bay"
