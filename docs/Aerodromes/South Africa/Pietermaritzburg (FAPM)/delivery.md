# Delivery

!!! info
    Pietermaritzburg does not have a dedicated Delivery frequency, as such all Delivery responsibilities are assumed by Pietermaritzburg Tower (FAPM_TWR). Under no circumstances should a FAPM_DEL position ever be opened without prior approval from staff.

## Route Validation

!!! warning
    All flights departing out of FAPM must have their route checked and be in compliance with the latest Route Matrix set out by the ATNS. The Route Matrix below has been provided for easy cross checking of flights.

| Destination / FIR Exit | Routing                                 | Restrictions   | Remarks                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| FAOR                  | PMV LYV EPSAK UZ29 STV | *              |                                          |
| FALA                  | PMV BEBAS UZ29 STV LIV | *              |                                          |

These are the only two routings provided by the ATNS Route Matrix. Most flights may follow the same path as those out of FALE. If unsure, coordinate with a unit above.

## Departure Procedures

There are no published departures out of Pietermaritzburg. All departures and clearances are subject to the release of Durban Approach (FALE_APP).
Before issuing a clearance, the Tower controller must first coordinate a clearance with the respective unit covering Durban Approach. If there is none, see at the end.

In some cases, if an aircraft is ready before clearance has been issued, the clearance can be provided during the taxi or backtrack of the aircraft on the runway.

### Release without a station covering Durban TMA

Should a station to cover the Durban TMA not be online, then the release of departures will be at the discretion of Tower.
Initial Climbs shall be provided up to altitude 6000ft initially, to provide some deconfliction with the Durban inbounds and outbounds.

In this case, the after departure instruction for the aircraft will be "left/right turn direct [first waypoint excluding PMV]."

i.e. "after departure Runway 16, left turn direct LYV"

## Phraseology

**The passing altitude to be issued in clearances is 5000ft.**
