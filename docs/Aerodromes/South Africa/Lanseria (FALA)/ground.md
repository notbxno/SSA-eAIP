## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with the SMC controller, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* Persons on Board
* Fuel Endurance
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the SMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.
At Lanseria, filing a flight plan as VFR is not mandatory unlike Cape Town, so you do not need to ask for a pilot to file a flight plan.

!!! info "VFR Phraseology"
    "ZSHLA, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 07, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."


## Pushback Procedures

**An aircraft must be squawking their assigned ASSR code provided in the clearance before pushback clearance is issued. If this is not the case, the SMC controller must instruct the pilot to do so BEFORE any push clearance is issued.**

    "(callsign), push and start approved, face (direction), QNH (QNH)."

## Taxi Procedures
