# Delivery

!!! info
    GVAC Has no actual GND or DEL frequencies, so these positions should not be connected to unless explicit permission is granted. When they are offline TWR assumes the responsibility of GND and DEL on the TWR frequency and should never 'Cross couple' with the GND/DEL frequencies

!!! Warning
    When aircraft are leaving the Sal TMA to either the North, South or West (Not to Mainland Africa) The controller working the DEL responsibilities **MUST** ensure the aircraft connects with a designated SELCAL code and put the SELCAL code in the 'Notes' section of the aircraft's Tag.

## Phraseology

The Sal FIR use standard ICAO phraseology with a few added segments, an example of this would be
*Cleared to [Destination], [Departure] Flightplaned route, Climb FL [INIT CLIMB], Squawk [Squawk] (If not already Provided ("Confirm SELCAL code"))*

!!! Note 
    The Controller working the DEL controller position may provide a SELCAL check to pilots after their clearence has been obtained. They may do this by doing '.selcal XX-XX' followed by their SELCAL code, to which this would check the pilots SELCAL works.
