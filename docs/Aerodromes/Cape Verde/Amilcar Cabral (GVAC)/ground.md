# Ground
The responsibility of GMC at Amilcabral Ground falls to the dedicated Ground ATS unit, "Amilcabral Ground" (GVAC_0_GND) on 122.650 MHz. GMC will be responsible for the aerodrome movements outside of the runway, including pushback and taxi to/from the runway. GMC will also be responsible for the initial call of VFR aircraft looking for start and taxi to the runway.

## Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Aircraft.
On initial call with GMC, the VFR aircraft is expected to provide:

* Aircraft Registration, if the callsign used is not the aircraft registration
* Aircraft Type
* *Persons on Board* (Optional)
* Intentions

Once this data has been received by the GMC controller, the controller shall then issue the QNH, Active, and if operating on a FPL, a squawk.
At Sal, filing a flight plan as VFR is mandatory.

!!! Tip "VFR Phraseology"
    "GPHPY, thank you, start up approved, expect Runway 06, QNH 1015, report ready for taxi."


## Restrictions

On all taxiways the largest aircraft that operate at GVAC IRL is the 787-800 operated by TUI, **No larger aircraft are permitted to operate at the airport IRL**. However on VATSIM pilots dont understand this so you may get A/C larger than the 787-800, as a result of this ATC *may* deny pilots if they do this however this is not recommended

### Stand Restrictions

!!! Note "Stand Restrictions"
    All stands allow Medium aircraft to ocupy them I.E. A320/B738 However it is recommended that if larger catagory of aircraft connect they ocupy stand 10, 8, 7, or 6


### Taxiway and Apron Restrictions

!!! Warning 
    All taxiways in the airport have a Width of 23 M, as a result any larger aircraft must be reminded of this and that it is taxi at their own risk and must maintain a good amount of spacial awairness

    !!! Tip "Phraseology for A/C with a wingspan > 23 M"
        "TOM1VY, Runway 01 Taxi via E, B, A1, Caution Taxiway width"

    !!! Tip "Phraseology for A/C with a wingspan < 23 M"
        "TOM1VY, Runway 01 Taxi via E, B, A1"



## Pushback Procedures

Pushback is very self explanitory however some outliers exist, examples of which will be featured bellow:

!!! Note "Pushback on 01 Operations"
    Aicraft located on stand 07 *Could* be instructed to push into Taxiway C (This would be given **INSTEAD** of a push direction), this improves Operational efficiency to the airport as it free's the apron area during high traffic

    !!! Warning 
        On MSFS GSX profiles do not have this as an option and therefor most aircraft wont be able to push like this
    
    All other stands are required to push facing south 

!!! Note "Pushback on 19 Operations"
    Aicraft located on stand 01 *Could* be instructed to push into Taxiway E (This would be given **INSTEAD** of a push direction), this improves Operational efficiency to the airport as it free's the apron area during high traffic

    !!! Warning 
        On MSFS GSX profiles do not have this as an option and therefor most aircraft wont be able to push like this
    
    All other stands are required to push facing North 


!!! Tip "Phraseology for pushback"
    "TOM1VY, Push and start approaved Face North/South/Into taxiway X, QNH XXXX"



### Arriving Aircraft
When an aircraft arrives into GVAC, it is recommened to issue a progressive taxi, this is due to the small size of the apron, an example of this is provided bellow.

!!! Note "Progressive taxi example during runway 19 operations"

    ![alt text](Progtaxi.png)

    At first the aircraft should be instructed to taxi via A1 and hold short of B

    Once sure the apron will be clear for the passing aircraft, they may be cleared into the apron

    !!! Warning 
        Common sense should be applied when using progressive taxi, as it may not be necessary for apron operations


!!! Tip "Phraseology"
    "TOM1VY, Taxi via A1 holdshort **OF** taxiway B"

    Once sure the apron will be clear from their arrival:
    "TOM1VY, taxi stand XX via E"
